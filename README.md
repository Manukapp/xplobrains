Exploding brains by Faruk, whom I met at the OHBM Hackathon 2022.

The Julia directory is to install Julia Language, which is a computationally more efficient language to perform the fluid animations created by Omer Faruk.

The Exploding Brains directory was cloned from https://github.com/ofgulban/exploding_brains.git/
